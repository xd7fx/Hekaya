Historic Jeddah,"Welcome to Historic Jeddah — the beating heart of the Red Sea for over a thousand years. As you walk through these narrow alleys lined with coral stone houses and latticed wooden windows, you're stepping into a living museum — a place where merchants, pilgrims, and explorers once gathered before heading to Makkah.

This city was more than just a stop for trade or Hajj. It was a crossroads of cultures — Indian spices, African fabrics, Yemeni incense, and Ottoman influences all passed through these very doors.

Look up — see those wooden balconies? They’re called “Rawasheen”, and they tell a story of families watching the world from shaded windows, of cool sea breezes, and voices echoing down the alleys.

And over there — that’s Beit Nassif, one of the city’s most iconic houses. Built in the 19th century, it once hosted kings, scholars, and storytellers. Its spiral wooden staircase still stands, inviting your imagination to climb.

Today, Historic Jeddah is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, not just for its architecture, but for its soul — a place where stories still whisper from the walls, and every stone holds a memory.

So walk slowly, listen closely — because here in Old Jeddah, the past is never far away.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXAMPLE1
Qasr Shada,"Welcome to Abha, the highland jewel of southern Saudi Arabia — where the clouds drift low, the air is cool, and every stone has a story. Surrounded by the soaring Sarawat Mountains, this city has long been a center of culture, poetry, and history.

At the heart of the old town stands Qasr Shada, or Shada Palace — a traditional mud-brick fortress built in the early 20th century. Once the seat of regional administration, it now stands as a living museum, preserving the memory of the Asir region’s rich past.
Look closely at its walls — crafted from stone, wood, and clay — and you’ll see the elegance of Asiri architecture, shaped by mountain life and generations of craftsmanship. Inside, the rooms hold relics of everyday life: handmade tools, traditional clothes, and photographs from a time when the palace echoed with decisions, prayers, and poetry.

Abha is not just beautiful for its nature — it’s a city of stories, whispered through mountain winds and told in places like Shada Palace.

And here, in this quiet stronghold above the clouds, you’re not just a visitor — you’re part of a story still being told.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXAMPLE2
ad-Dir'iyah,"Welcome to Diriyah — the cradle of Saudi Arabia and the birthplace of its unification. Here, in the valley of Wadi Hanifa, surrounded by palm trees and ancient mud-brick walls, history lives on in every alley and fortress.

Over 300 years ago, Diriyah became the capital of the First Saudi State. It was a thriving center of learning, trade, and diplomacy — a place where tribes gathered, alliances were formed, and visions of unity began to take shape.
Look ahead — that’s At-Turaif District, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its iconic Najdi architecture, with its geometric patterns and sturdy earthen walls, tells the story of a people deeply connected to their land and values. 

Within those walls, leaders like Imam Muhammad bin Saud laid the foundation for what would become the modern Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

This wasn’t just a town — it was a movement, a symbol of resilience and revival. Though it faced battles and was once left in ruins, Diriyah rose again — restored with care, not only in stone but in spirit.

Today, Diriyah welcomes the world not just as a historic site, but as a living destination — where the past inspires the future, and every step echoes with legacy.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXAMPLE3
Mada'in Saleh,"Welcome to Madain Saleh, once known as Al-Hijr — one of the oldest and most remarkable cities in northern Arabia. You're now standing in a place where people lived more than 2,000 years ago, and where the Nabataeans carved grand tombs into the sandstone mountains with incredible precision that still amazes us today.

But this city wasn’t just a place of burial. It was a thriving stop along the ancient incense trade route, full of life, culture, and travelers from across the region.

Look there — that’s Qasr al-Farid, or “The Lonely Castle.” Notice how the lower part of the tomb is rough and unfinished? That’s because its owner passed away before it was completed, and no one dared touch it afterward. Now, it stands as one of Saudi Arabia’s most iconic monuments.

Madain Saleh also holds deep religious significance. It’s mentioned in the Qur’an as the home of the ancient tribe of Thamud, to whom the prophet Saleh was sent. When they demanded a miracle, a she-camel emerged from the rocks — but after they defied the command to protect it, a divine punishment befell them. What remains here today are the silent homes of a once powerful people, frozen in time.

In every corner of this place, there’s a story carved in stone — a living memory of civilization, faith, and legacy.",https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1iQ7ovt1Q4VZk8OOyPENQpq5rHGkfOQka
